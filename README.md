# Renovate Bot Samples

This repository provides snippets that you can use to build your Renovate Bot configuration for your repository.
It is kept up to date on best effort basis, but you should always check
the [Renovate Bot documentation](https://docs.renovatebot.com/) for the latest information.

I will add more samples as I encounter them. Feel free to create a PR if you have a good sample that you want to share.
